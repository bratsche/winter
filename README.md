winter

Brace yourself.

This is a simple utility to help run Rails commands faster. It depends upon the
`spring` gem by @jonleighton https://github.com/jonleighton/spring

winter is a spring client written in C, mostly written as an experiment. The
takeaway from this experiment was mostly that RubyGems does not support packaging
C programs that are not Ruby extensions.  That being the case, there is no
convenient way to distribute winter and so it probably won't be maintained any
further.
